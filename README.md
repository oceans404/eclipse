# ðŸŒ’ Eclipse

Eclipse is a private data marketplaceâ€”a private AI agent answers your questions about encrypted content so you buy with confidence.

## The Problem

Today, buying private data requires blind trust in the seller. As a buyer, you can't verify what you're getting without seeing it, and sellers can't prove their data's value without giving it away for free.

Eclipse solves this with a private AI agent that has access to the encrypted content. Buyers can ask the agent questions about the data or request it to verify that the content matches the creator's title and descriptionâ€”all before committing to purchase. This bridges the gap between "I can't see it" and "I know what I'm getting."

## MVP

### User Flow

- A creator can upload a private image, title, description, and set a price in PYUSD
  - After the image is uploaded, a private AI agent is granted access to the image
- Users can ask the private AI agent questions about the image to make an informed decision on whether to buy the image
- Users can pay to unlock the content

### Payments

- A smart contract tracks PYUSD payments per product id
- Envio indexes payment events
- A verifiable compute service grants access to content after successful payment events
