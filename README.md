# üåí Eclipse

**Verify before you buy. Protect until you sell.**

Eclipse is a private data marketplace where an AI agent analyzes encrypted content to answer buyer questions‚Äîcreators don't leak their work until they get paid.

- **Live Demo**: https://eclipse-pm.vercel.app
- **EthGlobal Showcase**: https://ethglobal.com/showcase/eclipse-n93ec

## The Problem

**Buyers can't verify.** You want to know if a dataset has the right format, if a meal plan works for vegetarians, if a tutorial matches your skill level‚Äîbut you can't see the content until after you pay.

**Creators can't scale.** Every buyer has different questions. You answer DMs endlessly, try to predict FAQs, and still miss edge cases. Sleep through a notification? Lose the sale. Give away too much detail? Also lose the sale.

## The Solution

Eclipse runs **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash inside Nillion's Trusted Execution Environment (nilCC)** to access encrypted content and answer buyer questions in real-time.

- **For Buyers:** Ask the AI anything. Get real answers before you commit. "Is this vegetarian?" "Does this include coordinates?" "What skill level?"
- **For Creators:** Upload once. The AI handles unlimited buyer questions automatically. Zero customer support.
- **For Trust:** Content stays encrypted everywhere except in the TEE's memory during analysis. Payment verified on-chain via Envio before download access.

No previews. No leaks. No blind purchases.

## How It Works

1. **Creator uploads** ‚Üí Content encrypted with AES-256-GCM, stored in Vercel Blob + Nillion nilDB
2. **Buyer asks questions** ‚Üí Gemini 2.0 decrypts content in TEE memory, answers with privacy guardrails
3. **Buyer pays in PYUSD** ‚Üí Smart contract payment indexed by Envio
4. **Instant access** ‚Üí TEE verifies payment, grants download
